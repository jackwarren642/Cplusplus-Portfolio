WELCOME-

My name is Jack Warren, a computer science student at Butler University for the Class of '28.

Below you will find a quick itinerary for the different files I have here in my C++ portfolio-

CS142Final.cpp- a simulation library with about ten different functions that can be used to edit a struct and arrays of books and their corresponding information. This program corresponds with the "input.txt" file.

HW1.cpp- my first C++ program, a very rudimentary cin/cout conversation with the user

HW8.cpp- using MPI, this parallel program is used to calculate the sum of pi based on an 'n' count of terms using the pi formula.

MT2V2Final.cpp- a program with multiple functions involving array-based transformation based on a randomly generated array

coordinate.cpp- a relatively rudimentary program that simply takes a coordinate point and determines which quadrant it would be located in.

dectobinary.cpp- program which takes a user-input integer and converts it into its binary form value.

distance.cpp- a very simple, logic-based program which simply calculates the cost of a trip based on different intervals of pricing based on total distance.

esp.cpp- inputs number grades from the "esp.txt" file and then calculates different class statistics as well as converting the grades into letter grades- it outputs those results into the "result.txt" file

loop.cpp- very basic functions based on the fundamentals of loop, including the printing of a horizontal line, SOS codes and the calculation of the range between two integers.

mathoperations.cpp- a very rudimentary program that simply prompts a user to select a math operation to be conducted on two integers.

password.cpp- a program which uses "flag" variables to check a user-input password and ensure that it is "strong" according to the preset criteria.

perfect_number.cpp- as the name indicates, simply contains the formula to determine if a positive number is a perfect number

shapes2d.cpp- a simple program that takes user input to determine the area of 2D shapes

shapes3d.cpp- a simple program that takes user input to determine the volume of 3D shapes
